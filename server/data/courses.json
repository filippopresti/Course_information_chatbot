How to apply At UAL you may start your Degree in either September or January and we encourage you to apply as early as possible: Step 1: Check entry requirements Qualifications Minimum entry requirement is an upper second class honours (2:1) degree or equivalent from a recognised higher education institution. However, a master's degree in an appropriate subject is considered to be a particularly valuable preparation for the academic and intellectual demands of an MPhil or PhD. In some instances, applicants without the minimum academic requirement may be considered for a place if they can demonstrate appropriate alternative qualifications, relevant professional experience, or previous research. Teaching experience is not a requirement for applicants, the quality of your research is the most important element of your application. English language If English is not your first language, you will need to meet our English language requirements by providing one of the following: A recent UAL-approved English Language Test (ELT) - such as IELTS 7.0 with a 7.0 in writing and with no other component score lower than 6.0, or an equivalent test score - check the English language requirements webpage to see which other English language tests the University accepts; Recent MA degree (Merit or above) in a majority English-speaking country; Successful completion of UAL's Presessional Academic English Programme. Your qualification needs to have been awarded no more than 3 years prior to your enrolment date. You can apply before you receive your English Language Test or MA certificate. If you are offered a place, you will need to show your qualification before enrolment. Requirements for distance learning overseas online applicants In addition to meeting the standard academic and language eligibility requirements, applicants to the distance learning overseas online mode need to demonstrate that they: can successfully conduct their research with the resources available to them at their distance learning place of study have access to appropriate IT facilities, so that they can engage in supervision and training from their distance learning place of study have the necessary time, commitment, and appropriate attitude toward distance learning online study. Students on this mode do not hold a Student Visa so cannot enter the UK for the purpose of study or access UAL physical resources or buildings. Distance learning students have access to online resources available to all postgraduate students. Please check that the distance learning route is recognised in your home country before submitting your application. Please note: we advise overseas applicants to apply well in advance of preferred start date as the Student Visa application takes a minimum of 6 weeks. Step 2: Draft a research proposal Your research proposal is the most critical component of your research degree application. It will form the basis for discussion at your interview, and if your application is successful your proposal will also be used as the starting point for the Registration process. Use the personal statement section of the online application form to tell us anything you couldn't express in the rest of the application within a 500 word limit. How to write a research proposal PDF 713KB Step 3: Find a supervisor At UAL all students have 2 supervisors. We ensure that across the team there is both subject specialist knowledge in the field of your research and methodological approach, as well as experience of successful research degree supervision. You may wish to approach a potential supervisor before applying although this is not necessary. We will find the best possible supervision team for your project on receiving your application. When approaching a potential supervisor, you are advised to have a good draft of your research proposal ready. If you know the name of a potential supervisor and have your proposal ready, you can contact them – find their contact details on our UAL Staff Researchers database by name or keyword.

Our definition A personal statement is your opportunity to share your story and show how your skills and experiences make you a good match for your subject area. It's your opportunity to tell us what inspires you, what you're interested in and why you want to study your chosen course at UAL. Where to begin? All applicants will need to answer 3 separate questions that UCAS has provided. The total character limit is 4,000 characters or less. The questions are: 1. Why do you want to study this course or subject? 2. How have your qualifications and studies helped you to prepare for this course or subject? 3. What else have you done to prepare outside of education, and why are these experiences useful? These questions encourage you to reflect on your journey so far, as well as your future. While the questions are separate, bridging the gap between the past, present and future is really important. It shows you’ve made an informed decision about your chosen course or subject area. Find out more about what to include in each question at: UCAS.COM 7 tips for your personal statement It's all about you. Your personal story is what makes you unique and stand out from the crowd. Think critically about using AI tools. Your writing should be your own work and an honest reflection of you. Make it relevant. Talk about examples and experiences that match your course criteria. What about extra-curricular activities? Do you do any volunteering or have any hobbies? Keep it clear and concise. Create a clear narrative and avoid long sentences and complex words. Watch out for errors. Ask someone else to read it and check for mistakes. Practice makes perfect. You may need to write a few drafts before you're happy. Read aloud.

    "text": "Portfolio advice Applying to university is an exciting next step and your portfolio is an important part of this process. Discover our tips on how to build a strong digital portfolio for your university application. What is a portfolio? It’s a collection of your work demonstrating how your creativity has developed over time. It shows your ability to work with different materials, themes and techniques, as well as how you research, develop and plan your ideas. And the mistakes you’ve made along the way. It’s a way of showing us your skills, personality and potential – we want to see you within the pages. Applying for a postgraduate course? Get advice on the documents and tasks you may need to prepare. Watch the full series Head over to our YouTube channel to hear more tips and advice from UAL staff and students. How to create your digital portfolio A digital portfolio is simply a digital version of a physical portfolio – the advice about what to include in each is similar. It involves photographing or scanning physical work, such as sketchbooks and 3D objects, to turn them into digital files. Once your work is prepared, you’ll create digital pages ready to upload later in the process. The following 8 steps will guide you through the process of creating a digital portfolio for UAL: 1. Check your course webpage It’s important to consider the focus of the course you’ve applied to as they each have different portfolio requirements and selection criteria. While these tips will help you build your portfolio, always check the ‘Apply now’ section of your course webpage to check what's being asked. 2. Select your work Include work from between 3 to 5 projects to show a range of ideas and skills. Remember to check your course webpage for specific requirements, but it could include things like: drawings sketchbook pages research video 3D objects. Show us variety, even if you love a certain technique or material. If you select group work, make this clear and explain the role you played in the project. 3. Show your potential We’re not just looking for polished, finished work. It’s about your potential and the journey you’ve been on, including experimentation and any mistakes you made along the way. This is especially important for an undergraduate course application. 4. Create a narrative Organise your portfolio by project and tell us the story of each of them. Show us how you got to your idea – from the concept all the way through to completed pieces. Think research, process and outcome. 5. Prepare your work Now you’ve selected your work, get it ready to include in your digital portfolio. This is likely to involve taking good quality photos or scans of physical work. It may also mean editing videos or sound files into short clips or showreels. 6. Build your pages Lay out your work digitally using any software you like including InDesign, PowerPoint or Canva. These layouts will form your digital portfolio pages. A landscape page format is best. Avoid overcrowding your pages with too much work or adding decorative backgrounds – white space can be a powerful presentation tool. Check our How to create a digital portfolio video for more detailed guidance. 7. Annotate your work Keep any annotations on pages short, clear and concise. Size 12 font is the minimum size for on-page annotations. Where relevant include details of the materials used, the size and scale of your work and the date it was created. PebblePad, our online portfolio tool, allows you to include annotations during the upload process which can be a great place to add this kind of information. 8. Upload to PebblePad Once you’ve created the individual pages, you’ll upload them to PebblePad – our online portfolio tool. When organising your pages, start and end with your strongest work to make a good first and last impression. If you've been asked to send a video task, this is also submitted on PebblePad. The video task is uploaded to one of your pages and it's included in your page allocation. Check out our How to upload your portfolio page for detailed advice. How to submit your digital portfolio You’ve double-checked the portfolio requirements listed on your course webpage, selected your work and created your pages ready for the next stage of your application. So, what happens next? 1. Check your emails You’ll get an email from us with a link to our online portfolio tool PebblePad soon after submitting your initial application. This email will give you the deadline date and time for submitting your portfolio. The deadline is around 7 to 10 days after getting the email. Make sure you check your junk or spam folder. This email will also be available in your UAL Portal. 2. Login to PebblePad Once you get the link to PebblePad, try and login straight away. This gives you time to sort out any technical issues. Use a browser such as Chrome to login – avoid using Safari as it can cause login issues. We won’t be able to offer any extensions to the portfolio submission deadline so logging in straight away is really important. If you can't login, reply to the email immediately to let us know. 3. Submit your portfolio Once you're logged in to PebblePad, you can go through the process of uploading your prepared portfolio pages and video task, if this has been requested. Full instructions on how to upload and submit your digital portfolio can be found on the How to upload your portfolio webpage. This includes a list of the file types PebblePad accepts.

    "text": "How to upload your portfolio Submitting a portfolio or video task? To help us assess your application, we may ask you to upload a portfolio of your work and/or a video task which are both submitted via PebblePad. Your specific course page will tell you exactly what you need to submit. You must upload your portfolio and/or video task by the deadline we give you. A portfolio is a collection of work that showcases your skills, personality and creative potential. Each course may ask for specific content they want to see in your portfolio. Explore our portfolio advice to help you. A video task is a 2-3 minute video some of our courses ask you to submit to find out a bit more about you. Check your course page for specific instructions on this task. Read our advice on how to prepare for and film your video task. Applying for a postgraduate course? Get advice on the documents and tasks you may need to prepare. Logging in to PebblePad We will email you a PebblePad username and password when we are ready for you to upload your portfolio, this is after you apply. Your PebblePad login details will not be the same login as the one you use to access your UAL Portal. Your PebblePad login details will be the same for all the courses you are applying to, but not all courses will ask you to upload at the same time. Don’t worry if you receive requests at different times. Uploading to PebblePad Log in to PebblePad using the login we send you via email. Click on the course that you need to create a portfolio or upload a video task for — remember these are submitted at the same time if you are asked for both. If you can’t immediately see the course once you login, don’t worry, we will email you when it’s time to upload your portfolio. Click on the ‘Portfolio’ tab in the top left of the page — this is the same if you're submitting a video task. Click on the ‘Choose media’ button to select the files you want to upload. Watch our video to see how to upload and annotate your work in PebblePad. You can’t make changes once you submit your work, so only submit your work when you are certain. Once you've finished, the home screen will show a ‘submitted’ status. You will also receive an email confirmation. Take a look at the  Terms and Conditions for PebblePad (PDF 53KB). Files you can upload When uploading content to PebblePad you have to use the file types below, or it won't work. Make sure you upload high quality scans or photographs of your visual work wherever possible. Images: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, png Audio: mp3, mp4, ogg, wav, wma Video: avi, mp4, mpeg, mkv, mov, wmv We accept the following file sizes only: 4000 pixels in either height or width 512MB. Every applicant uploads the same number of images (pages) required by the course to make the process fair. Please remember if you've been asked to submit a portfolio and a video task, this needs to be done at the same time and within the 'image' allocation. eg: 20 images means 1 of these must be your video task, it can't be additional. Need help? For queries about your submission, reply to your PebblePad invitation email. If you have any technical issues, email PebblePad.Support@arts.ac.uk with the following details: your name your student ID the college you applied to the name of the course(s) you applied to the device and browser you are using a brief description of the issue you are having. We try to respond within 2 working days, but our reply may take longer during busy times."

    "text": "Interviews: What to expect An interview gives you the chance to share your knowledge and enthusiasm about the course you’ve applied to. If you’re invited to interview, here’s what you can expect. How do interviews work at UAL? Once you’ve submitted your course application, you may be invited to an interview. Not all courses require applicants to attend an interview. Check the course webpage to see if an interview might be part of the application process for your course. You will find this information under the ‘How to apply’ section of the course web page. How will I attend my interview? All interviews are conducted online using Microsoft Teams. All interviews are scheduled in UK time. Please be aware of the time difference if you live outside of the UK. Your interview will be 15-20 minutes with a member of our academic team, though your allocated interview slot may be longer than this. We recommend that you use a desktop or laptop for your interview, rather than a mobile device. Check that you have a strong internet connection and a power cable ready. Online interviews are conducted to the same standard as in-person interviews. Please have your camera switched on, choose a quiet room, dress appropriately and make sure your phone is on silent. You will usually receive information confirming timings approximately 1 week before the date of the interview. If you have any access requirements, please let us know as soon as possible by emailing admissions.interviews@arts.ac.uk so we can support you during your interview. Using Microsoft Teams Download the Microsoft Teams app or visit the Microsoft website and sign up for free using a personal email address. Don't use a school or college email account as schools and colleges tend to block calls that are outside of their network. Similarly, if you're already studying at UAL, don't use your UAL email address to set up your Microsoft Teams account. Create your account at least 3 days before your interview. How to join my interview On the day of your interview, use the link provided in the interview confirmation email. Once you click the link, you’ll be admitted into a lobby area (a waiting room). Wait here until your interviewer is ready, they will admit you. We’re very keen to interview you. However, sometimes interviews can overrun, and you might be waiting a little longer than expected. If you’re not admitted from the lobby area after 20 minutes, please stay in the lobby and email admissions.interviews@arts.ac.uk. If you lose connection part way through, don't worry. Follow the steps to rejoin the lobby where you will be admitted back into the meeting room. What if I'm unable to attend my interview? Let us know immediately by emailing admissions.interviews@arts.ac.uk. We’ll then let you know if there’s a possibility of rearranging your interview. If you have accepted an invitation to attend an interview and you notify us that you can’t attend at least 24 hours ahead of the interview, we’ll offer you another interview as long as there is enough time left before we have to release application outcomes. If you have accepted an invitation to attend an interview and you don’t attend, fail to respond to our invitation, or don’t notify us that you can’t attend at least 24 hours before, there is no automatic right for us to rearrange your interview. We’ll make a decision based on the information in your application. We may withdraw your application for not attending an interview. If you are an applicant for a postgraduate taught course and you apply after the Round 2 deadline, it is unlikely that we will offer you the opportunity for an interview due to time constraints. Interview tips Reread your course page and personal statement. relevant artists and styles. Do a practice interview with your family or friends. What do we look for? Knowledge and skills: Tell us about your creative journey so far. Use your personal statement and portfolio as helpful cues. Passion and curiosity: What excites and inspires you? We want to see your enthusiasm and curiosity for your subject area. Ask questions: This is just as much your opportunity to ask questions and make sure UAL is right for you. Creative potential: Tell us about your aspirations and how your course can help you achieve them. Confidence: It's natural to feel nervous but just try to be yourself. We just want to learn more about you and your love for your subject. What next? Toggle caption You've applied to UAL but what happens next? After you apply?

    "text": "Conditional and unconditional offers If your application to study at UAL is successful, you’ll receive an offer email, an update in your UAL Portal or a notification from UCAS. There are 2 types of offer that you could receive. However, an offer must become fully unconditional before you can study at UAL. Conditional offers A conditional offer means you still need to meet certain conditions for your place to be confirmed. The condition(s) of your offer may vary, for example you may have an academic condition and/or an English language condition. The conditions will be specified in your offer email or via UCAS. Please read your offer carefully and if you have any questions, contact us via the UAL Portal. Once you have met all the conditions, your offer will be updated to an unconditional offer. You won't receive a new offer letter, but don't worry, you’ll be able to see your updated offer in your UAL Portal and/or on UCAS. Unconditional offers If you receive an unconditional offer, it means you have no academic conditions or English language conditions to meet, based on the information provided in your application. You will still need to upload evidence of your qualification(s) via your UAL Portal, in the ‘my Application(s)’ tab – you should do this as soon as possible. What to do next Step 1: Accept your offer You should respond to your offer by the deadline given in your offer email. If you applied through UCAS, you should accept your offer through UCAS. If you didn’t apply through UCAS, you can accept it via the UAL Portal. Step 2: Meet the conditions of your offer As soon as you receive your academic results, please scan your certificates and upload them to the UAL Portal. If you need to provide evidence to show that you’ve met our English language requirements, you’ll also need to upload these results via the UAL Portal. If your course starts in September/October 2024, this must be done by the following dates: 31 July 2025 for postgraduate courses 31 August 2025 for undergraduate courses 15 August 2025 for pre-degree courses. If your course starts in January 2025, you must meet your conditions by 10 December 2025. The next 3 steps are for international students only. Step 3: Pay your deposit (International students only) If you’re an international student, you must pay a deposit of £4,000 as soon as possible after accepting your offer. Once you have enrolled, the deposit will contribute towards your total tuition fee payment. To do this, login to your UAL Portal, go to 'my Application(s)' and click the 'Pay your deposit' button. Step 4: Receive your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number (International students only) If you’re an international student, you will need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) statement to apply for your Student visa to study in the UK. Once you have completed the first 3 steps above, we will process your CAS statement. The soonest you can receive a CAS is 3 months before the course start date. We are automatically notified when you are eligible to receive your CAS. Please wait to hear from us. Read more about Student visas and getting a CAS statement. Step 5: Apply for your Student visa (International students only) You can start your visa application once you’ve received your CAS statement. Before you start, visit our Student visa page for useful advice and step-by-step guides. Missed a deadline? If you miss the deadline to accept your offer or meet your conditions, contact us via the UAL Portal to discuss your options. Terms and Conditions Please refer to the UAL Terms and Conditions, which can also be found in your offer letter.

Stage 3 - Final formal stage If you are not satisfied with the response given at Stage 2, you may proceed to Stage 3 only if you can show the following: You have new information which for good reason was not available at Stage 2. This information must be essential to the complaint. The University failed to follow its procedures at Stage 2, which disadvantaged you.

The decision of the Associate Director of Admissions and Applicant Relations after the review is completed is considered final. For complaints relating to the process that was followed, the Associate Director of Admissions and Applicant Relations will appoint a person(s) within the University to carry out an investigation. This person will not have been previously involved in the complaint. Following the investigation, the investigator will write and submit a report containing recommendations to the Associate Director of Admissions and Applicant Relations. The Associate Director of Admissions and Applicant Relations will determine what action will be taken. The action will be communicated in writing to the applicant. This communication normally takes place within 30 working days of acknowledging receipt of the Stage 3 complaint. We ask applicants not to contact the University until this period has expired.

    "text": "English language requirements Last updated:17 April 2025 You must demonstrate that you have a good level of English to study at UAL. Most students from outside of the UK will need to submit results from an English language test. The IELTS test is one example of a test that UAL accepts. You do not need to take an English language test before you apply. Please see the information below regarding the English language requirements process. English language requirements Each course at UAL has a minimum English language requirement. Check the entry requirements section on the relevant course page. The English language requirement is expressed as an overall IELTS score between 5.0 and 7.5. There are also minimum skills requirements. We accept several other English language tests in addition to IELTS. Pre-sessional English courses If you do not currently have the language test score that you need, you will need to take another test. We offer pre-sessional English courses to improve your English level. You can check your eligibility. UAL's Progress Test If you are a current UAL student, you can take the UAL Progress Test instead of IELTS or another external test. Your current test result must be less than 2 years old on the start date of your course. Exemptions If you meet all the requirements of one of the below categories, you don’t need to take an English language test. Select each title below to read an explanation of each category. Category 1 - English speaking countries You are a national of a majority English-speaking country. Majority English speaking countries are designated by UK Visas and Immigration. Check the list on GOV.UK: Student Visa. You have completed full secondary-level education in a majority English-speaking country. If you took only part of your secondary education in the UK or a majority English speaking country, you are not exempt from taking a test. Category 2 - Permanent and legal UK resident You are a non-UK national who is permanently and legally resident in the UK. You have an existing immigration status that permits study and you will not require a student visa during your studies with us. You have completed full secondary-level education in the UK or in a majority English-speaking country. If you took only part of your secondary education in the UK or a majority English speaking country, you are not exempt from taking a test. Category 3 - Degree taught in English You hold a qualification equal to a UK undergraduate degree or higher which was taught in English. Your proposed course of study at UAL will be at least RQF Level 6 (BA, MA or above). These qualifications are valid for 3 years from the date of issue and must be valid on the start date of your course. We set minimum grades for each qualification. Please see the 'Degree qualifications' section below to see what we accept. If your degree is not listed, get in touch using the ‘Contact Us’ button in your UAL Portal after you have applied. Category 4 - UK English qualifications If you completed one of the following English Language or Literature qualifications in the UK when you were 18 years old or younger, you may be exempt from taking an additional test: GCSE A-level Scottish National Qualification Scottish Higher Advanced Higher After you have applied, contact the Admissions team using the ‘Contact Us’ button in your UAL Portal. We will ask you to upload your certificate. These qualifications are valid for 3 years from the date of issue and must be valid on the start date of your course. We set minimum grades for each qualification. You can check the minimum grades required for each qualification under 'Alternative qualifications' below. Essential information Check your test is valid Your English language test must be valid on the start date of your course. Check the information under 'Test scores' below to confirm how long your test result is valid for. We are not able to give extensions. Minimum skills requirements You must achieve 5 language scores. One is an overall score, and the rest are for listening, reading, writing, and speaking. There are minimum scores you must achieve for each skill, which are listed under 'Test scores' below. You must achieve your scores from a single sitting of a test. We do not accept results from tests taken at different times or 'best of' results. We will accept an IELTS One Skill Retake for applicants who need to retake one of the 4 skills within their IELTS test. If you retake one skill, IELTS will give you a new certificate which will specify which skill you have retaken. We will accept a certificate that confirms a One Skill Retake as long as you have met all the score requirements and the test will be less than 2 years old on the start date of your course. We will not accept a cumulative score, across multiple attempts on different IELTS certificates. If you have a disability, your test provider may allow an exemption from a component of the test. They may also offer accommodated testing. Please note that accommodated testing takes several weeks to arrange so you must book your test early. We are not able to accept lower scores on the grounds of disability, so please make sure any accommodations are arranged when you take the test. IELTS Academic for UKVI If your condition includes 'IELTS Academic for UKVI', you must provide a certificate for this test or another UKVI approved Secure English Language Test (SELT). We cannot accept: IELTS Academic (non-SELT) IELTS General (non-SELT) IELTS General (SELT) IGCSEs If you take a Cambridge IGCSE, you must: Check you have taken a syllabus that assesses all 4 skills separately (listening, reading, writing and speaking) and gives a score for each skill.

It can take up to 28 days to provide. Your iGCSE must be less than 3 years old on the start date of your course. Please note, if you took an IGCSE between 2020 and 2022 you may not have been externally assessed in every skill. Test scores This breakdown of minimum scores is intended as a guide only.

Programme detail Start dates in September and January/February Available at Camberwell College of Arts, Central Saint Martins, Chelsea College of Arts, London College of Communication, London College of Fashion and Wimbledon College of Arts. Full information on dates, deadlines and fees. What to expect This programme is designed to allow students to experience UK student life on our BA and BSc programmes. Students will have the same coursework and schedule as a home student and should anticipate independent-style learning and a collaborative environment. Usually applicants will be either majoring or minoring in their chosen subject or have a developed portfolio in the subject area. Classes Integrated Study Abroad students choose a degree programme and take classes in that core subject area. This is designed to develop further specialist technical skills, with the aim that students explore, develop and expand upon their own ideas. These are essential skills required for a career in the creative industries. The Study Abroad team at UAL can send applicants course handbooks containing detailed information on the curriculum and classes for the selected degree course. Students often find it useful to have a copy of the course handbook when they meet with their academic advisors at their home institution. The course director at UAL will assign students a programme of classes during their first meeting in London. Watch videos from some of our Study Abroad lecturers. Credit All degree courses at UAL are credit rated. Students earn credit points when they successfully complete a learning unit. Each individual credit point normally equates to 10 hours of learning across 2 areas: taught or tutor-directed learning self-directed study with access to College facilities. Assessments might include project work, logged and written assignments, and other work as appropriate. Study Abroad students can take classes for their home institution to award external credit. 120 credits are available for each year of study and this typically breaks down into 40 credits per term. At the end of the course, we will provide a record of study listing the grades the student has achieved for each unit and their equivalent UK credit value. Students are advised to ensure their home institution will award external credit before they travel to London and enrol onto their elected Study Abroad Programme. The Study Abroad team can provide course handbooks to both the student and their advisor to demonstrate what will be studied during their time with UAL.

    "text": "UAL Creative Computing Institute launches new online course in partnership with Google Written byNiamh Ryan Published date 11 December 2023 Facebook X Snapchat UAL Creative Computing Institute collaborates with Google to launch new course in machine learning for next generation web development. UAL Creative Computing Institute (CCI) has collaborated with Google to launch a new online course in machine learning for web development, using Google’s TensorFlow.js open source machine learning library. The free online course was developed in collaboration with Google as a significant part of CCI’s new BSc and MSc courses in Data Science and AI. Students on these courses are among the first to have the opportunity to work with TensorFlow.js as part of their degree. Working closely with key industry partners in course design enables CCI to realise its mission to develop the next generation of creative technologists with the skills to meet the needs of the future. This approach is also a core element of CCI’s masters conversion programme in data science, which was designed in collaboration with the creative industries. MSc Data Science and AI for the Creative Industries equips arts and humanities graduates with applied computer science skills and data science training, developing technical proficiency within a creative industries context. TensorFlow.js is an open source machine learning library - produced by Google - that enables users to create production-grade machine learning models that can run entirely client side in the web browser. Delivered on the online MIMIC (Musically Intelligent Machines Interacting Creatively) platform, also developed in collaboration with Google, the course brings machine learning to the browser through interactive coding exercises, open to anyone anywhere in the world. The course – designed for anyone with a basic working knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS - to develop essential skills in the creative application of machine learning through a JavaScript specific lens, building hands-on experience working directly with the TensorFlow.js library. MIMIC’s browser-based delivery offers a uniquely accessible and inclusive way of learning the essentials of coding, drawing on the full range of the TensorFlow.js library to explore a wide range of creative opportunities for machine learning. By making skills in using new technologies widely available to a wide range of professionals from creative technologists and web developers to artists, the course aims to make a unique impact on the creative industries. Mick Grierson, Professor of Creative Computing at UAL, says: \"CCI are committed to working with partners like Google to make AI and machine learning education and research as accessible as possible. The world is an unequal place, and one of the dangers of AI is that it will simply reflect the world's inequalities, rather than help us challenge and overcome them. We need a greater diversity of voices, perspectives and approaches in order to meet these goals. Our platforms and research agenda are designed to help support this vision, and it's been great to move this forward in partnership with TensorFlow.js.\" Jason Mayes, Web AI Lead at Google, says: \"Web-based machine learning has been expanding exponentially in usage over the recent years due to its unique benefits of being able to run on device. This enables user privacy, lower latency for real time applications, and lower costs as no expensive hardware needs to be hired in the cloud and kept running 24/7. Now is the perfect time to upskill creative thought leaders of tomorrow with skills in artificial intelligence in the languages they use most. For almost 70% of developers, that language is JavaScript, not Python, so it is exciting to see UAL embrace TensorFlow.js in their teachings to students who are already using web technologies to bring their ideas to life, giving them one more tool in their toolbox of technologies they can put to good use in their future careers as we move to a world where AI is top of mind across industries.\" the MIMIC project MIMIC (Musically Intelligent Machines Interacting Creatively) is a collaborative web platform for the artistic exploration of musical machine learning and machine listening, designed as an interactive online coding environment engineered to bring new technologies in AI and signal processing to artists, composers, musicians and performers all over the world. The MIMIC machine-learning platform was created in 2019, also in collaboration with Google, as a £1 million project funded by UKRI/AHRC."
